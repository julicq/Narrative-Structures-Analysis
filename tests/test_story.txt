It was a dark and stormy night. John sat by the window, watching the rain. Suddenly he heard a knock on the door. His heart beat faster. Who could have come in this weather? John slowly walked to the door. His hand trembled as he turned the knob. A stranger in a black cloak stood outside the door. “Help,” he whispered and fell unconscious. John dragged him inside and closed the door. What should he do now? He didn't know, but he felt that his life would never be the same again.
