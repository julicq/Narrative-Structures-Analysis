We see a lady’s hand pour a cup of water into a cooking pot on a gas. (We can hear the water being poured as the pot is hot.)



CUT TO
 
INT. A DARK ROOM WITH VERY DIM WHITE LIGHT

We see a close up of a lady’s (in her mid 30’s) face. We can see a pillow under her head. She is in deep pain and shouting. 
(No sound. We can hear a background score)


CUT TO INT.KITCHEN 

We see a lady’s hands breaking a block of uncooked noodles and adding it to the water which is now hot. We can see a few bubbles being formed.


CUT TO

EXT. IN A CAR ON A BUSY ROAD

We see a man (in his late 30’s) driving a car. He is sweating profusely and has a worried look on his face. He is in a hurry and wants to reach somewhere. (We can hear busy traffic)

We see the lady’s hand add some MASALA (mixture of powdered spices) to the cooking noodles which is now half cooked.

Once again we see the close up of the lady in pain. She has sweat all over her forehead and face. She is banging her head on the pillow.




CUT TO EXT.THE MAN IN THE CAR 

The man is frantically trying to make way through the traffic. He is honking continuously. 


CUT TO INT.THE DARK ROOM 

The lady is still in pain and we see a man’s hand slowly moving over her hair trying to calm her down.


CUT TO EXT.THE MAN DRIVING 

He is frustrated and angry now and looks in the rear view mirror and then looks on the back seat.


CUT TO INT. THE KITCHEN 

We see the noodles which have now started boiling with the water. The color has changed as the water, noodles and MASALA has mixed. We see lady’s hand as she uses a spoon to mix everything.

The same car pulls over just inside the gate. We can see the drivers face through the gate as the car pulls over. He is in a hurry as he opens the door and steps out.

The noodles are ready and we can see the lady’s hand switch off the gas and pour the noodles into a serving bowl.


CUT TO INT. THE DARK ROOM 

We hear a baby crying and then a first person shot of the lady being given a new born baby in her hand. 
CUT TO THE LADY’S FACE  
We see a shot of the lady now smiling and tears rolling down her eyes as she takes the baby in her arms. There is a doctor and 2 nurses in the room (OUT OF FOCUS)


FADES INTO A BLANK SCREEN

We hear a sound of a baby crying which slowly transitions into the sound of a man crying and yelling loudly.


THE BLANK SCREEN FADES INTO A SHOT OF THE MAN (the driver)

He is crying over a blood soaked body of a young boy (around 6 to 7 years old) just outside the entrance of a hospital. We can see his car parked behind him with the back door open. We see a few hospital ward boys in the background (OUT OF FOCUS)


FADES INTO A BLANK SCREEN

THE SCREEN FADES INTO A BLACK
